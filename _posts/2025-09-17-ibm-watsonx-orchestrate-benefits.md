*My colleagues Volker Kuhm and Leonard Brucksch and I have written an article outlining the benefits of IBM watsonx Orchestrate titled 'AI Agents for Business'.*

Below is our short version. For more details read the [product page](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate) and the [Buyer’s Guide](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/10a99803cbafdc57). I also published a slightly more technical article [Top five Reasons why to use watsonx Orchestrate Agents]({{ "/article/five-reasons-why-watsonx-orchestrate/" | relative_url }}).

## Introduction and Benefits

IBM watsonx Orchestrate makes AI real for the business - turning potential into practical outcomes.

Enterprises are under increasing pressure to scale AI investments beyond isolated pilots and proof of concepts. That’s where IBM® watsonx Orchestrate comes in. This platform is designed for orchestrating AI agents, assistants, and workflows—built specifically for enterprise environments.

The platform connects to the tools already in use - whether that’s Workday, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, or homegrown systems - and works across any model or automation framework. What sets it apart is the ability to bring AI agents and other systems together in one integrated workspace - so they can interact, delegate, and solve problems on behalf of the business.

Embracing IBM watsonx Orchestrate leads to a remarkably efficient, agile, and scaled-up business operation. By minimizing manual effort and expediting decision-making processes, your organization will experience a surge in productivity and responsiveness. This is not merely automation; it's the power of enterprise AI collaborating harmoniously with your team to deliver substantial, tangible impact across your entire enterprise. 

## Flexibility and Integration

As enterprise automation evolves, many recurring tasks will increasingly be standardized within domain-specific contexts such as HR, procurement, finance, and more. These tasks are often tightly coupled with platforms like Workday, Salesforce, SAP, and other specialized systems. To avoid having every organization rebuild the same integrations and logic from scratch, there is a growing need for reusable connectors and tools that can be centrally maintained, cataloged, and directly adopted. This approach not only accelerates integration into existing IT landscapes, but also significantly broadens the range of tasks that AI agents can perform for employees in daily operations.

IBM watsonx Orchestrate addresses this need by providing a rich library of pre-built, domain-specific connectors and tools. These ready-to-use components enable organizations to expand agent capabilities with minimal effort - making it easier to orchestrate meaningful, business-relevant interactions across enterprise platforms.

However, given the vast diversity of business processes and industry-specific needs, it will become increasingly difficult for any single provider to cover the full spectrum of scenarios alone. That’s why a strong and scalable partner ecosystem is essential - one that enables third parties to contribute ready-made agents and tools tailored to their domains and industries. IBM watsonx Orchestrate is built to support exactly that by the possibility that Business partners can develop and publish their own agents and tools, making them centrally accessible within the Orchestrate environment. This not only accelerates solution availability for end users but ensures that the platform grows with the needs of its community - driven by openness, specialization, and collaboration.

## Open

The development of generative AI models is progressing at high speed, with new models and agentic frameworks constantly emerging - each optimized for different use cases and strengths. In such a dynamic environment, the ability to flexibly choose and apply the most suitable model becomes a key success factor.

IBM watsonx Orchestrate embraces this by offering a high degree of openness and model choice. Users can access a variety of models - such as IBM’s Granite family, Meta’s LLaMA, or Mistral - either hosted natively on the watsonx platform or connected via an external gateway. Furthermore, watsonx Orchestrate supports industry standards like MCP and A2A, enabling seamless integration of tools and agents from diverse sources.

This approach empowers organizations to confidently embrace models that perfectly align with their unique needs, seamlessly adapt as technologies advance, and maintain freedom from vendor constraints, ensuring unwavering long-term adaptability and strategic alignment with their business goals.

## Hybrid

The business purpose of modern IT solutions is highly diverse - just like the agents that will operate within them. These agents will come with varying infrastructure requirements; some demanding high performance, others requiring strict security or compliance with regional regulations. This creates a wide range of demands on the orchestration layer itself - from the need to process sensitive data locally for data protection reasons, to requirements for global availability or cost-efficient deployment in the public cloud for less critical tasks.

To meet these varied demands, the orchestration of agents must offer a high degree of adaptability, empowering organizations to implement the deployment strategy that best suits their operational and regulatory context. IBM supports exactly this by enabling watsonx Orchestrate to run wherever it makes the most sense: on-premises in the organization’s own infrastructure, or in the cloud with a hyperscaler of choice – such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or IBM Cloud.

## Simple to Advanced

As AI agents become more central to daily business operations, the range of users interacting with them is expanding rapidly. These users differ significantly in their roles, goals, and technical backgrounds. On the one hand, there are business users who simply want to solve a task - without worrying about how an agent works - by triggering the right one through a conversational interface. On the other hand, there are domain experts within business units who recognize opportunities to automate their own repetitive tasks, but who typically lack programming skills. And finally, there is the technical community: developers and engineers who want to build complex agents using custom frameworks and code. This diversity presents a challenge: how to empower all user types - from non-technical to highly technical - to work productively with agents, whether they are consuming, configuring, or building them?

IBM watsonx Orchestrate is designed to be used by all kind of users. It offers an intuitive, pre-built chat interface that allows business users to trigger agents using natural language. For subject matter experts, the platform includes low-code and no-code tools that make it possible to create custom agents through a graphical interface - with the option to add light scripting if needed.

For technical builders, IBM provides the watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) - a set of tools designed to make it easy to build and deploy agents using watsonx Orchestrate. It is packaged as a Python library and command-line tool that allows builders to configure agents that run on the IBM IBM watsonx Orchestrate platform. The ADK also supports integrating agents and tools built on other frameworks, making it possible to extend the platform with powerful, custom-built logic.

## Secure

The rise of AI agents introduces a new layer of access to enterprise systems - one where users interact indirectly with data through agents. This increases the risk that sensitive information could be exposed to unauthorized individuals if proper controls are not in place.

IBM watsonx Orchestrate addresses this by enforcing end-to-end security across all layers: every agent is subject to role-based permissions, authenticated access, and governed through secure, authorized connections. The integrated credential vault ensures that credentials are managed securely, reducing the risk of misuse or data leakage through agent interactions.
